## Description
In this application the user will be able to quickly generate an html file that has a card for each employee the user added after invoking the initial inquirer prompt by opening the intergrated terminal in the index.js file and typing "node index.js". The user will be asked what kind of employee they would like to add and can use the arrow keys on their keyboard to select if they would like to add a Manager, an Intern, or an Engineer. The user can add as many employees as they would like and once they are finished they can select the "I'm Finished" choice and an html will be generated to reflect each employee the user added.
